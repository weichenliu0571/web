        <h2> Who is S1mple? </h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1mple"> Simple </a> was better than the average gamer the moment he picked up a gaming computer. <br>
        His reflexes were insane and his game sense was insane. It did not take long before professional esports team offered him contracts to play for them. <br>
        S1mple's first team that he played for was called the "LAN DODGERS" and he did not get along with his teammates. <br>
        However, after many people critisized him for his toxic behavior in games, he changed for the better. <br>
        Currently, S1mple playes for NaVi, which is probably one of the best CSGO esports teams out there right now. <br>
