    <h2> What is CSGO? </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive"> CSGO </a> is a first person shooter game. It is a fairly old game. <br>
      Skin in CSGO are basically skins on weapons that you could use in game. You could buy them off third person party websites or you could buy them off steam. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
      CSGO has a skin economy that is very similar to the stock market.<br> 
      If you make the right decisions, you could easily profit off this game's economy. <br>   
    </p>
        <h2> Who is S1mple? </h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S1mple"> S1mple </a> was better than the average gamer the moment he picked up a gaming computer. <br>
        His reflexes were insane and his game sense was insane. It did not take long before professional esports team offered him contracts to play for them. <br>
          </p>
        <p>
        S1mple's first team that he played for was called the "LAN DODGERS" and he did not get along with his teammates. <br>
        However, after many people critisized him for his toxic behavior in games, he changed for the better. <br>
        Currently, S1mple playes for NaVi, which is probably one of the best CSGO esports teams out there right now. <br>
                 </p>
    <h2> What do I think of S1mple? </h2>
    <p>
      I believe that S1mple is the best player in CSGO. Sometimes he doesn't try as hard as he could, but at the end of the day, CSGO is a game. <br>
      I think that a game should be for your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness"> enjoyment </a>.
